# Cointegration and Stationarity Ideas for Pairs Trading

In this Jupyter notebook, I would like to show you some ideas behind Pair Trading and Statistical Arbitrage, higlighting the importance of statistical analysis, in the form of Cointegration Analysis as well as defining, and analysing the stationarity of a time series.

These are ideas that can be applicable in a pair trading context, however we let the reader analyse on their own and further develop on this initial grounding, which is purely based on Time Series Analyisis and Statistics, and no trading results are presented for the sake of the notebook!
